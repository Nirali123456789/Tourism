        <p>Regarded as one of the iconic symbols of the state of Rajasthan, the Hawa Mahal (Hall of Winds) sits in the centre of Rajasthan’s capital, Jaipur. Built as an extension to the women’s chambers of the city palace, it was intended as a viewing screen. Through this screen—a kind of architectural veil—women of the royal household could freely view the bazaar and its vibrant proceedings unseen. The term mahal in this context is almost misleading, as the building was never meant to serve as a residence. The five-story building is actually quite shallow, with the top three stories being barely a room deep and containing chambers in which the women sat.
            In keeping with the visual language of the “Pink City” of Jaipur, the Hawa Mahal is built entirely in red sandstone, which in the sunlight glows with a pink hue. It is often identified as the world’s tallest building constructed without a foundation. Although it is credited to the Rajput style of architecture, it also has very strong Mughal influences manifested in the symmetry of the facade. This facade, which is 50 feet (15 metres) high, has more than 950 windows, each painted with motifs in white limewash, The main entrance is at the rear of the building, where a series of ramps lead to the upper stories. These were designed to facilitate palanquins (chairs carried on men’s shoulders).
